In this repository, the final work of the master's degree course in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics - Academic Year 2020-21, Sapienza, Rome

This thesis work was born and developed within the European context: AIPlan4EU: https://www.aiplan4eu-project.eu/   from the collaboration of the Procter & Gamble Services Company - Belgium, and Sapienza University of Rome.

I had a chance to develop a a robotic simulator in Docker container, a framework for AI planning that includes the paradigm "Human-in-the-loop", and the design of various AI plans. 

This thesis is the starting point of a project that, started on January 2021, will continue for the next three years. This and the works that will be subsequently developed, will be stored and published in the GitHub repository of Prof. Luca Iocchi : https://github.com/iocchi
